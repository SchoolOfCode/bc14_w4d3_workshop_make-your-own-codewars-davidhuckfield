Feed Sancho!

Sancho the tortoise can only eat fruits & vegetables. He can't eat meat or dairy.

You have to sort through all the food objects in the fridge and only return the foods that Sancho can eat.

Write a function that takes an array of objects and returns a new array with only the food objects whose type is fruits or vegetables.

You will only get input that is an array of food objects, examples below:

E.g if input is [
    {name: 'apple', type: 'fruit'}, 
    {name: 'banana', type: 'fruit'}, 
    {name: 'carrot', type: 'vegetable'}, 
    {name: 'cheese', type: 'dairy'},
    {name: 'chicken', type: 'meat'}
] 
then the output should be [
    {name: 'apple', type: 'fruit'}, 
    {name: 'banana', type: 'fruit'}, 
    {name: 'carrot', type: 'vegetable'}, 
]
